# Folding Holder

This repository includes the 3D file for the course MEC-E7006: Advanced Manufacturing.
The model should be printable without supports or any other post-processing.

The final model has a captive screw, the 'folding holder' model doesn't and can be printed in parts. It's also missing the intendation to keep the flap shut.
